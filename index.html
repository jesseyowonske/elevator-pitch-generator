<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we will need to make some changes on your style.css file. developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block." You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image on the style.css page. Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder (directory) as this project (hint: simplify the name). Add a project name and provide a flashy subtitle-->

<!--in this next section you need to answer the first question of stasis, that of conjecture. What is the problem? Can it be solved?-->

 <h1>Conjecture</h1>
   <h2>The problem is that the film studies department is not getting as much interest in their projects, events, and faculty accomplishments as they might want. By designing a user-friendly interface, anyone would be able to easily navigate features i.e., a calendar of upcoming events. </h2>
   </div>
  
<!--Add the photos to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add to the names on the grid below. You can add more if you wish, or subtract...see what happens--you have to be playful to find the purpose of things.-->

 <h1>Definition</h1>
 
   <h2>One possible feature of the interface would be a calendar that integrates touch-swipe support. The main feature will be to have a swipeable list of faculty that when clicked on will show that faculty member’s current project.(Social Media Board)

 <h1>Quality</h1>
    <h2>The film department is looking for someone to create a touch screen UI to advertise their projects. If we don’t do anything, then the film department doesn’t get any more advertising than they currently do. </h2>

 <h1>Policy</h1>
  
   <h2>First, we plan to consult with the University of Pittsburgh Film & Media Studies department to determine the specifics of this project. Next, we will make an outline on paper of how our interface will work. Finally, we will code and test our interface and work on the graphics of it. </h2>
